# Lichess Distance Calculator
Calculate your win separation from the World Champion (and others) on Lichess. That is, you can find out who you beat, that beat someone, that beat someone, that beat Magnus in the October Titled Arena.
That is: 
```
1: You beat them
2: You beat someone who beat them
3: You beat someone who beat someone who beat them
4: You get the drift
```
Right now, I only use all the games from October-- sorry!
In the coming weeks, I'll try to get a solution with all games. However, if you played in October you can pretty easily calculate an upper bound on your win distance.
